# Text Indexer
**TextIndexer** is a Go-based command-line tool designed to efficiently index and retrieve text content. It processes large text files by generating **SimHash fingerprints** for fixed-size chunks, enabling fast and accurate content lookup. Whether you're indexing documents or searching for specific text, TextIndexer delivers performance and simplicity.

## Introduction
This program was developed to address the challenge of efficiently indexing and retrieving content from large text files. Traditional methods of text search can be slow and resource-intensive, especially when dealing with massive datasets. 

By leveraging **SimHash**, a technique for generating similarity-preserving fingerprints, TextIndexer provides a fast and scalable solution for content lookup and near-duplicate detection.

This tool is particularly useful for applications like:
- **Document similarity detection**: Identifying near-duplicate content in large text corpora.
- **Content retrieval**: Quickly locating specific phrases or chunks within large files.
- **Text analysis**: Enabling efficient processing of large datasets for NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks.

This document provides a detailed explanation of the tool, including the algorithms used, the approach taken, performance insights, unique techniques, and clear instructions on how to run the program and its test cases.
